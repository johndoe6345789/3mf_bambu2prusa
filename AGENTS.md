# AGENTS

These instructions follow a simple MIT-style approach: minimal bureaucracy and maximum clarity.

## Scope
- Applies to the entire repository unless a subdirectory provides its own `AGENTS.md`.

## Guidelines
- Keep changes small, focused, and well-documented in commit messages.
- Match existing code style and avoid introducing unnecessary dependencies.
- Add or update tests when behavior changes to preserve reliability.
- Prefer readable, maintainable solutions over cleverness.
- If you add new files, include brief module-level comments describing their purpose.
